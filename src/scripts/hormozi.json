    "text": "A few years ago, I realized I wasn’t unhappy anymore.\n\nThe main change: living life noting “good days” and “bad days”. \n\nThen, looking for the things I could control that happened on good days.  \n\nThen, deliberately repeating them.\n\nThis lead me here: \n1) I eat the same stuff. This minimized bad food experiences and kept me in shape. Which always made me feel better than not being in shape. \n\n2) I lift weights with people I like. I noticed I always had good days if I worked out with people I liked.\n\n3) I work on something I could see visible progress on (I write everyday). I noticed when I did that, I felt some larger accomplishment.\n\n3.5) Later I realized if I did that activity with a friend, it made it even more enjoyable. Which is what has given birth to @DrKashey and my daily writing sessions.\n\n4) I unwind with a nice view. I noticed when I had a dedicated place to sit quietly and read or reflect my days went better.\n\nThat’s about all I’ve got that actually made me less unhappy. \n\nSimply paying attention to what happened on good days then trying to recreate it might’ve been one of the most valuable things I’ve done for myself. \n\nTLDR: I spend as much time as I can doing things I like with people I like and ignore as much of everything else as I can.",

Writing one that actually gets read…the hardest. \n\nI think when I die I’ll be most proud of my books speaks to why I put so much time into them. \n\nAnyways thank you all for your support. On Jan 1 2024, it cracked 20,000 Amazon reviews with a 4.9 rating. We’ve sold over 850,000 copies now.\n\nIt’s wild how much publishing a purple book 2.5 years ago has changed about my life.\n\nWorking hard on volume 3 of the $100M book series. You’re gonna love it. It’s the sexiest of the book topics.\n\nHere’s to a year of breaking beliefs, breaking records, and breaking through ✊🏽",

So I get it. \n\n“He probably rented that private jet.” - you’re right. Chartering is renting. We agree. \n\n“He’s on steroids.” - yep. I’m on testosterone. And if u take ‘more’ they become steroids.\n\nSo you kinda just say “yea - I get it” rather than fighting it. And it uses up a lot less mental energy. \n\nBecause the worst case is they make a point about your flaws. \n\nAnd if you were ‘t trying to publicly save face, you’d probably agree. \n\n‘Yea I am an idiot sometimes. Yea I can be selfish. Yea I could’ve made that better…etc’\n\nThis all stemmed from a question about ‘hate’ comments. \n\nAnd the honest truth is - I think I come to agree with most of them. \n\nWhich transformed them from hate into ‘observations I agree with’. Which I have no reason to fight.\n\nTLDR: A different lens I’ve found helpful.\n‘What if they’re right?’",

And they are the reasons I admire you. Ways I’d like to grow more like you. \n\nIn our lives, you are the glue. You create space for people to be themselves. And as a result, everyone wants as much of that as they can. So everyone naturally assembles around you. \n\nAnd as far as “leading from the front” - I don’t think it’s an accurate descriptor for what it’s like. \n\nYou lead from the middle because you bring everyone closer together. \n\nAnd the world still doesn’t get it - and maybe they never will. \n\nThey see you as some woman business creator. Which is whatever. \n\nBut the people who know, know that you’re the reason we have what we have. You are - and have always been the heart - of everything we do. In the middle. Like gravity. Drawing everyone together.\n\nAnd - being the winner that you are - on your birthday we have a full work day with podcasts and meetings lined up. And you forgot it was your birthday. Because everything you do has never been about you. It’s been about everyone else. \n\nAnd that’s why we love you so much. \n\nHappy birthday. The world is better with you in it. I hope I can grow up and be like you someday. \n\nThank you for keeping my world turning. @LeilaHormozi",

    "text": "Ways to not feel stressed when ‘bad’ stuff happens:\n\n1) Decide it isn’t bad. It just is. Remind yourself that you’re the one calling it bad. Most ‘bad’ things in the micro becomes ‘good’ things in the macro. \n\n2) See if you can remember something of equal importance from 20 years ago. If not, it probably won’t matter in the future. And it won’t matter then, it doesn’t matter now.\n\n3) Imagine this bad thing happened every hour of everyday for the next two years. How would you feel on the 1,000th time of this happening? Probably like it’s just ‘part of life’. If it can feel that way then, it can feel that way now.\n\n4) Remind yourself that if you zoom far enough out in space. Right now. That you can’t even see the earth. Reminds us that big problems are only big when compared to small things. Change what you compare your problems to, and they become small problems (or stop being one all together).\n\n5) Remind yourself that right now. We remember entire civilizations as the ancient “X-ans”. Romans. Sumerians. Babylonians. And we may be the Ancient Americans to a future gen. Barely even remembering names of leaders. If we can’t remember their names, their problems certainly didn’t matter.\n\n6) Jail. Bankruptcy. Ridicule. Whatever “terrible” thing it is. Be grateful that you get to have this unique human experience. Most people may not ever experience it. But you can. Which gives you deeper insight no one can take from you. And that’s something to be grateful for. \n\n7) Remind yourself that the output of hard circumstances is strong character. After all, hard people don’t come from easy times. So we can’t wish for one without the other. In many cases, we’re getting our wish - to become the best version of ourselves. And this is just the way we become it.\n\nThese frames have helped me more than I can say. Hope they helps you.",

And that’s what creates confusion.\n\nThe nice thing is though - if you want a win tomorrow - it’s gonna be hard to engineer and there’s a lot of competition. See: Day-trading and Jim Simmons. \n\nBut if you’re willing to expand the time horizon you can engineer most games to be un-loseable. \n\nIt’s because there’s little competition when you compete on a 20 year time horizon. So there’s plenty of room for big obvious moves.\n\nThen, you just gotta give time, time.",

    "text": "I’ve said that you should offer to work for free for someone to learn from them. Two caveats:\n\n1) Go for someone 1-2 steps ahead of you, not 20. Elon musk doesn’t need someone getting his coffee.\n\n2) Don’t offer to do stuff for free. DO IT. Don’t ask “how can I provide value?”\n\n^It’s now costing me time to try and figure out a way for you to provide value to me.\n\nBe an adult. Do your homework. Figure out what you can do. Then DO IT. And expect that the person won’t care. \n\nThen keep doing it. And if it’s good, they’ll give you a shot. \n\nYou gotta remember - you’re the one with everything to gain here. \n\nLow skilled labor is not in short supply. And training people is expensive.\n\nSo - if you want someone further ahead to give you a hand, give them something they’d wanna stick out their hand for. \n\nAnd if no one is taking you up on your offer, you’ve gotta make it better. Simple as that. \n\nAnd real talk - sometimes timing isn’t right. I had someone ask to translate one of my books for me. I was distracted. And I said I don’t have time for this now. Guy took it personally. 6 months later I hired a book manager and we’re translating in a lot of languages now. If he reached out now - it would probably work out. No different effort. Just timing FOR ME. \n\nAn offer I would take is something that helps me NOW. Make my life easier and faster INCLUDING the interaction w the person (hard hurdle). \n\nReal real - if you wanna do something for me you’re probably gonna have to do work for a leader in my company. Then they’ll offer you a job and I won’t be involved. \n\nAnyways - the work for free cheat sheet:\n1) Target people a couple steps ahead not eons ahead. \n2) Provide the value first. Don’t ask what you can do.\n3) Make then an offer so good theyd feel stupid saying no: what they want, easier, faster, risk free. \n\n—>and realize that the timing may not be right - and be willing to ask more than one person or ask again in the future without getting butthurt.",

    "text": "To Ivante - the young man who stopped me at the grocery store working 2 jobs with a 1 year old who asked for advice on how to get ahead - I gave you a short answer because I was in a rush and it ate at me. So if you follow me here, maybe you’ll read this.\n\nWhat you’re going through is tough. \nBeing so young and already having to support a child is not easy.\nBut you’ll have the opportunity to become an amazing inspiration in a way I never could. Your success story will become your sermon.\n\nThat being said - onto the advice:\n\nYou’re gonna need to assume luck isn’t real. Or that it applies to everyone else but you.\nBecause the only way you’re gonna get out of your surroundings is by having something of value other people want.\n\nAnd right now, the only thing you have is your time - with low skills - to trade.\n\nWhich is a hard game to play.\n\nYou’ll have to trade a lot only to get a little.\n\nSo - you’re main objective is to have the time to learn a skill while providing for your family.\n\nThat means, in the short term, your family may have to suffer. Scratch that. Your family will suffer. But better now when they’re too young to remember than when they’re too old to forget.\n\nAgain, not forever. But for now. \n\nSo these are the things you’re gonna have to do. And this isn’t ‘dabble’ stuff. \n\nThis is - wake the f*ck up because if you don’t - you’re gonna blink and be 30 in the same spot, but worse. \n\n1) Cut all costs. And I mean ALL costs. You don’t eat out anymore. For anything. And if you’re hungry, you deal with it. If it’s not from a discount grocery store, you don’t buy it. Clothing - ha! What you’ve got is everything you need for the next two years. Period. No exceptions. Reuse. Trade or go to goodwill. You go to work. You go home. And home - is ideally with your family, or worst case, with another family also trying to make it and save. And it’s gotta be as cheap as you possible.\n\n2) Increase your income. You’re working two jobs. Your free time, spend applying to other jobs closer to what you want to do. Any at home phone sales job has starter roles that require zero experience that pay $40k/yr or more. Do that, and work your other job in between. If you can’t, drive Uber. If you don’t have a car, save up until you do.\n\n3) The easiest thing to sell is someone else’s stuff. So start there. Then, learn how to buy stuff for cheap and flip it. The bigger the thing, the more you make. You go from flipping cards to furniture to homes. And the limit never really stops there.  \n\nFinal note: I could hear the stress in your voice when you were talking to me about your situation. It sounded like you didn’t know what to do. Sadness comes from a lack of options. It’s a feeling of hopelessness. But whenever you feel that, I want you to think ‘this is ignorance not sadness—it means I don’t know enough, and that, I can control.’\n\nYou asked to come work for free for me. \n\nBut I have no need for low skilled labor. \n\nBut I do have need for high skilled beasts. \n\nIt’s why I make the books and the courses and the content, everywhere, for free.\n\nSo use those. Then get yourself a higher paying job. And everyday apply for higher paying ones (I recommend sales to start). \n\nThen once you get in there - for the love of god work until your fingers bleed because you have no other option. \n\nYou have no luck. Nothing is gonna work out in your favor. You’re not gonna catch a break. \n\nYou’re gonna have to make it happen. You’re gonna have to force it.\n\nYou’ve gotta become undeniable. \n\nAnd the best news is - you can do that in less than a year. \n\nSo that’s my advice: \n\n1) cut all your costs. Everything.\n2) work more to make more. And apply to better jobs. Learn to sell. \n3) Start selling more expensive stuff then eventually stuff you own. \n\nThe game is just trading up. Over and over and over again. You’re just a few trades away from a very different financial situation.",

He decides he wants to build his building into a 100-story building to prove how good of a builder he is. \n\nSo he tries to add stories on top. He gets to 15-16 stories and then the foundation begins to crack. He starts reinforcing things. But no matter what, he feels he can’t put anymore on top. \n\nOver time, the second guy keeps building and passes the first man.\n\nTwo years later the second man completes his 100-story building despite barely having his foundation finished by the time the first man finishes his entire building.\n\nThe first man, goes to a mentor to ask his advice on growing his building taller.\n\nThe mentor tells him “you need to tear down this building or start another one new”\n\nHe says “and waste all the time I spent building this one? Can’t I just add it on top if I just knew how?”\n\nThe mentor replies “there’s a lesson here: The fastest way to build a 10-story building isn’t the fastest way to a 100-story building. Your desire to grow fast ruined your ability to grow big.”\n\n**\n\nA lot of entrepreneurs build businesses as though it’s a race. \n\nAnd sometimes they reach their goals. \n\nThen they see someone with bigger goals and a bigger business. \n\nThey then try to build their business into that business. \n\nBut they can’t. \n\nBecause the fastest route to a $10M business is often not the fastest route to a $100M business. \n\nSometimes big things take time. And often that’s what makes them worth pursuing.\n\nDon’t compare a sky scraper to a townhouse six months into building.",
